# sailor
sailor is a flutter app designed to help you in your daily life.

## backstory
the original motivation for this project was to create a to-do app which i actually like using because so far i haven't found a solution which actually feels the way i'd like it to. most stuff either doesn't have features i want (subtasks, prioritization, etc.) or is to complicated so i can't achieve things in few clicks (which is really annoying if you do something ~20 times a day).

in the 10 months between deciding to do this and actually starting i've had a ton more ideas, so now it's more of a general life helper app.

also i wanted to learn flutter, so here we are.
